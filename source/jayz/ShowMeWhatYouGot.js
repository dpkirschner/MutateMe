Give the drummer some 
Shit, I already gave the summer some 
oIt's the winter's turn 
Hovie Hov is the coldest 
I'm just getting better with time I'm like Opus 
One young, no two alike, like a snowflake 
Okay, show me what you got, babe 
Words is slurring, engine purring 
Mami frontin', but I'm so determined 
Shots of Patron, now she's in a zone 
I ain't talking about the 2-3 
Mami in the zone like the homie 2-3 
Jordan or James, makes no difference, boo 
I'm ballin' the same, nigga, I am the Mike Jordan of recording 
Nigga, you might want to fall back from recording 
Shit that you write; it's not important 
So it forced him to go for the hype 
For being brave, and they may applaud him 
Well, misery I will assure them 
Aw, baby, just ignore them 
Truth or dare, mami, listen and learn 
I got a drop I just took off the top, it's your turn 
 
H.O.V.A., gold bottles of that ace of spade 
Why even fool with these other guys? 
They all stingy, all these dudes know how to say is 'gimmie' 
Gimmie some head, give me some brain 
Give me your number, gimmie your name 
But if I get one night, baby girl, I swear 
I'll make you tell these other dudes gimmie got you here 
I'll take you shopping, take long trips 
I'll take the cork off, you can take sips 
I'll take you there, take my time, take your clothes off 
I'll take off mine, ma, show me what you got 
Hovi in the spot tried to told you I was hot 
Tell these other dudes it's a wrap 
Get the fuck out the throne, you clone, the king's back! 
Y'all got less than two months to get y'all thing together, good luck! 
 
Ladies and gentlemen, the most incredible! 
H.O., uh huh H.O. uh huh, he's back! Uh uh 
Justin Blaze you the Blazettes 
Rocafella Records the dynasty continues, y'all die Peace
